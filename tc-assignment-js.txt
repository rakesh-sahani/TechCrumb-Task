Problem Statement: Create a simple JavaScript TODO application, preferably using ES6

Features:

Add :
This application will provide an input box, that will allow the user to create a TODO note. Once user types and text and hits enter, The TODO list will be saved in browser local storage or user cache. And it will list all the todo items created by user.

Delete:
When we hover on the item, a delete button will appear on that item. Clicking on this will remove that item.

Read:
There will be a checkbox/radioButton before each item. When that checkbox is checked, the item will be marked as read (completed) and it will be displayed as strike through.
